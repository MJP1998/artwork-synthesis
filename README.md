# Realistic Artwork Synthesis

I conducted this project with Michael Pilcer under the supervision of Professor Maks Ovsjanikov.

The goal was to propose an implementation of ArtGAN, the conditional categorical Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) introduced in the research paper of Tan, Chan, Aguirre and Tanaka. It is an extension of the original GANs to synthetically generate more complex images of artwork with abstract characteristics. To imitate human learning, the training was separated based on three classes: genres, artists and styles.
